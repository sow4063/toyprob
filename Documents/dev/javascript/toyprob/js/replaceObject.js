/*
Given an object with an arbitrary number of properties, any number of which may be objects or arrays,
replace all values which are strictly equal to the string:
"dynamic" with a given string occurring anywhere in that object or a child object or array.

Your solution should be recursive.

Your solution should be "in place" meaning it return the original object, not a copy.

Your solution should also include some type safety.
If a value that isn't an object or array is passed as the first argument,
it should just return whatever was passed in.
